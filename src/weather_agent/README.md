# Weather remote agent

This A2A server hosts a weather specialist that answers queries with fictional yet coherent forecasts generated by the OpenAI API. The host agent always consults it before recommending Airbnb listings.

## Prerequisites

* Install dependencies from the repository root.
* Export `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Optionally override `OPENAI_MODEL` or `OPENAI_WEATHER_MODEL` to choose the chat model used for completions.
* (Optional) Set `APP_URL` if the service should publish an agent card with a public URL that differs from `http://localhost:10001`.

## Run the server

From the project root:

```bash
python -m src.weather_agent
# or
make weather_agent
```

The service listens on `http://0.0.0.0:10001` by default and exposes a weather skill via its agent card.
